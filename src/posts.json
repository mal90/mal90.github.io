It is an execution context for expressions. `$scopes` are arranged in hierarchical structure which mimic the DOM structure of the application. `$scope` can watch expressions and propagate events.” .\n\nIn simpler terms it means that it is a way of tying an object to the DOM . If you consider the MVC model in Angular , the scope acts as a model . It is a template which hosts all the functions and the related data . Okay now that we have gotten some insight into the `$scope`.\n\nNow let talk about `$rootscope`.\n\n`$rootscope` is the parent (more like a root parent) of all the `$scopes` you create . It is the ultimate boss . It is (almost) like the Object class of Java .It is the top most `$scope` of your app and it contains ng-app directive . There is only one `$rootscope` for each of the Angular application .\n\n![ difference ](https://lazydevguy.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/blog.png)"},{"id":2,"title":"How to set Visual Studio Version With NPM","author":"Malik","date":"June 24, 2015","content":"## How to set Visual Studio Version With NPM\n\nWhen you install NPM modules in windows environment  , some times you might ran into an error like below.\n\n> C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\Microsoft.Cpp\\v4.0\\V120\\Microsoft.Cpp.Platform.targets(64,5): error MSB8020: The build tools for Visual Studio 2010 (Platform Toolset = ‘v100’) cannot be found. To build using the v100 build tools, please install Visual Studio 2010 build tools. Alternatively, you may upgrade to the current Visual Studio tools by selecting the Project menu or right-click the solution, and then selecting “Upgrade Solution…”.

In this case you can externally specify build platform toolset to NPM like this.\n\n```\n–msvs-version=2013 // I am running visual studio 2013 .
