But the process behind a git-rebase is not that simple as the definition suggests , but it is clean and awesome. In this post, I am going to go through with the process behind a git rebase, when to use it, and when to avoid it.\n\nLet’s look at the following simple scenario..\n\nSay you are creating a development-branch out of this master branch to do your development stuff.\n\n![git-rebase-intro](https://lazydevguy.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/git-rebase-1.png)\n\nAnd you are now working on this development-branch for sometime. You make changes, you add these changes and you commit those changes to this branch. Now after few days, you decides that it is the right time to integrate your changes to the master branch . But guess what, your team members have already pushed their changes to the master branch. So you cannot just easily merge your changes to the master without messing up the changes of your peers. Following diagram illustrates the situation\n\n![git-rebase-intro2](https://lazydevguy.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/git-rebase-4.png)\n\nAs you can see there is a gap between the branch you are working on and the master. This is where the it rebase comes in .By using git rebase you are going to integrate your changes (commit B1, B2) with the master (Where now the head is located at commit M3),\n\n![git-rebase-intro3](https://lazydevguy.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/git-rebase-2.png)\n\nNow the situation changes to something like below\n\n![git-rebase-intro3](https://lazydevguy.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/git-rebase-3.png)\n\nWhen you use git rebase , the commit history (commit hashes) changes entirely . That is why i have used the green color to represent the history instead of blue (color of master’s commits) or red (color of development-branch commits).\n\n#### Advantage\n\nIt creates a **Linear History** which is the very reason why we need to use git rebasing. Your history is clean flat and readable. You can identify the commits of each of your team members very easily in different timelines.\n\n#### Disadvantage\n\nIn a situation where you have so many people consistently pushing their changes to master and when there are so many branches being merged with the master, It is kind of a pain in the a** to keep your branch upto date with master using git rebase. You have to constantly do the rebasing, and might need to resolve conflicts time to time.\n\nAlso rewriting your commit history after each and every reabsing is not always a good thing. It means that your commit hashes change consistently and also, you need to **force push** every time to the remote after a rebase\n\n#### When to rebase:\nOnly when you need a clean linear history so that you can clearly see what is going on with the all the commits from all the team members.\n\n#### When not to rebase:\nIf you prefer to follow a simple mechanism where you can integrate your changes with the upstream branch without a fuss you can always go with [git merge](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging#_basic_merging)."},{"id":1482949800000,"title":"How to merge your silly little commits into one","author":"Malik","date":"December 29, 2016","content":"## Git : How to merge your silly little commits into one\n\nThere are three kinds of git users. People who commits every single change ; People who wait and compile all the changes into one gigantic commit. And the last kind is the best kind, who commits in a responsible way. I used to be the first kind, but realized later it is annoying to the people who reviews my PR’s. So here is the thing, git has 2 helpful ways of dealing with this problem.\n\n1. git squash\n2. git reset\n\nHere is the scenario. Say if you made some commits with small changes like remove small space 1, change variable name, remove space 2. Later you realize the commits are kind of silly, you want all these commits to be merge into one called something like code cleanup.\n\nUsing squash for this problem a bit complex (not if you get used to it). But it sort of gives you an overall idea on what is happening. This is how you do it.\n\n## Method 1: Using squash\n\nFirst of all make sure your master branch is up-to date with the related upstream branch. And say you are in a feature branch called, well feature-branch.\n\nin your git bash, run this command `git rebase -i master`\n\n![git squash](https://lazydevguy.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/git-sqush-1.png)\n\nyou will get the vim interactive console and you will see all of your 3 commits listed.\n\n![git squash](https://lazydevguy.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/git-sqush-2.png)\n\nHere the process is simple. You can pick one commit which can be your parent commit  using pick, and the rest of the commits can be linked under this parent commit using squash command. Also you can change the order of the commits as well. So according to our scenario, we can follow this way.\n\nAnd that is it. Just save and exit. And you will get another interactive console like below.\n\n![git squash](https://lazydevguy.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/git-sqush-5.png)\n\nAnd you have successfully merge 3 of your commits into one commit which is going to make a better commit history for you. Now you can just run `git push origin feature-branch –force` to push your single commit to the remote repository.\n\nNote: we are using `–force` because this process has changed the commit hashes. In any case, when you use force push, you need to absolutely make sure you know what you are doing.\n\nIf you view the commit history, you can see the squashed commits like this visualized in a different way.\n\n![git squash](https://lazydevguy.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/git-sqush-6.png)\n\nSo that’s how you squash your commits in Git. It is a bit time consuming process, but if you get used to it, it is very useful\n\n\n## Method 2: Using `git reset`\n\nSo unlike squashing your commits, you can easily merge your little commits into one using git reset command. It is really simple. Take the same scenario i have mentioned above. Now what you need is, Taking the HEAD position 3 commits back. By doing this you are resetting the last 3 commits.\n\n```\ngit reset –soft HEAD~3\n```\n\nNow you have un-stage changes. All you need to do now is to put them into a single commit.\n\n```\ngit commit -m “Code cleanup”\n```\n\nOr do these both together\n\n```\ngit reset –soft HEAD~3 && git commit -m “Code cleanup”\n```\n\nNow push `–force` to push the new commit into the remote repository. The same warning regarding force push applies here as well.\n\nmore info on squashing can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)"},{"id":1482949800000,"title":"How to face software engineering internship interviews?","author":"Malik","date":"December 29, 2016","content":"\n## How to face software engineering internship interviews ?\n\nI got the opportunity to do few interviews and mock interviews for the interns who were trying to get into the Industry as trainees. What i have noticed from the candidates are that they are extremely skillful, had good academic track records and some of them are very good at problem solving. However what i didn’t see was the preparation to face an interview. When the most common questions were asked, i saw the lack of ability to tackle those questions mainly due to the absence of preparation. So i thought of writing few tips on how to tackle an internship interview.\n\n### How to face it better ?\n\n#### First things first :\nYou should prepare a small “about-yourself ” description to introduce yourself to the interviewer . Because the first question would almost always be something like “Can you first tell us about yourself a bit” . This is something everyone easily messes-up  because it is so obvious!\n\n#### Stick to the script :\nWhen you introduce yourself to the interviewers, make sure to keep it short and sweet. It should be relevant to the internship. For example after stating the basic information (name, age, where you live), go with your overall academic records, projects you have done, any important contributions you have done to the IT community (such as open-source contributions, tech publications), any interesting hobbies and a bit about why you selected this field. You might not want to share your pet’s name, what your parents doing for a living.\n\n#### Bring a copied CV:\nIf the interview is onsite, this is important and is something always expected from a interviewee.\n\n#### Loud and clear:\nSome people are naturally soft spoken. But when it comes to interviews you need to make sure what you are saying is delivered to the interviewer. If the interviewer had to ask you again and again for something, it will create a negative impression. It will also show you that you are not in cable of having a efficient communication.\n\n#### Confidence and eye-contact:\nDon’t bore your interviewer by acting slow and dull. Show your enthusiasm in your voice and always keep a good eye contact. Attitude matters!\n\n#### Be honest:\nWhen you are asked about something about your self, make  sure you give the correct details. If you are not being honest at that time and if the interviewer later found out that you gave out incorrect details, you are done.\n\n#### About your projects:\nAlways have a look at the overall information about your university projects and you need to prepare for this before coming to the interview. There will be a question like “Tell us about your university projects”, So in that case it is important that you know how to explain what you have done . You might have done several projects, in that case, select one. 3 things need to be said during this question.\n\n1. Project description (domain, techs used, overall system architecture)\n2. What is your contribution\n3. Problems faced and the assumptions made\n\n#### Think out loud:\nYou will be given some kind of problem/scenario where you are required to provide a solution. The solution might be some pseudocode/algorithm or some high-level system design. Sometimes what happens is that you think about a solution in your head without expressing it, Which will result in a uncomfortable silence between you and the interviewer. In this case a pen and paper might come in handy. You can sketch it and show as to how you will approach the issue. So the interviewer will know you got the idea.\n\n#### Keeping your self updated:\nWhen it comes to IT field, It is imperative that you know a bit about the latest techs and trends. So always keep your knowledge polished by readings blogs, magazines etc. Also having a basic knowledge about the company is a must. Go through the company’s website, Facebook page, LinkedIn or another SM accounts and get an overall idea as a part of the preparation for the interview.\n\n#### Social media profile:\nHaving a LinkedIn profile is a good way of marketing your self for a job. Remember to include this in your CV. Also if you managed a blog, if you have a stackoverflow or a github account , share it with your interviewer. This will help him to understand your skills better.\n\n#### Passion and Mission:\nAnother obvious question is “How do you see yourself in n number of years”. Always prepare for this question before the interview. Also your plans should be relevant to the internship and the field.\n\n#### Ask questions:\nWhen you are asked a question such as ” Do you have any questions to be asked from us ? ”. Keep at least two questions prepared to ask at this point which also needs to be relevant to the context.\nFor Example :\n\n1. What are the new projects are being developed by your company ?\n2. How this place will help me to improve my career path ?\n3. If i get selected , what projects would be assigned to me ? what kind of part would i play in the company/project ?\n\n"},{"id":1454783400000,"title":"Resolve NPM install \"unmet dependency\" warning","author":"Malik","date":"February 7, 2016","content":"## Resolve NPM install `unmet dependency` warning\n\nSometimes when you try to install node modules, npm prompts the following warning message:\n\n![npm dependency issue](https://lazydevguy.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/capture.png)\n\n> npm WARN unmet dependency undefined,\nnpm WARN unmet dependency which is version undefined\n\nBecause of this some of the node modules might not get installed correctly.
