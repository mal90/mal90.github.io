It is an execution context for expressions. `$scopes` are arranged in hierarchical structure which mimic the DOM structure of the application. `$scope` can watch expressions and propagate events.‚Äù .\n\nIn simpler terms it means that it is a way of tying an object to the DOM . If you consider the MVC model in Angular , the scope acts as a model . It is a template which hosts all the functions and the related data . Okay now that we have gotten some insight into the `$scope`.\n\nNow let talk about `$rootscope`.\n\n`$rootscope` is the parent (more like a root parent) of all the `$scopes` you create . It is the ultimate boss . It is (almost) like the Object class of Java .It is the top most `$scope` of your app and it contains ng-app directive . There is only one `$rootscope` for each of the Angular application ."},{"id":2,"title":"2nd post","author":"Malik","date":"September 18, 2021","content":"# This is the 2nd blog\n\nsome content herea"}]
